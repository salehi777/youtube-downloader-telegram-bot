Written in NodeJS for getting youtube videos, locally or using telegram bot.

Audio and Video downloaded seperately then merged using ffmpeg. Also there is a function for re-encoding videos using ffmpeg because some of videos that uploaded to telegram displaying incorrecly (doesn't show time or miss thumbnail)

## üìù Scripts

```bash
yarn dev-tel # development mode for telegram-bot
yarn dev-loc # development mode for locally

yarn build # build both telegram-bot and locally into /dist
yarn start-tel # production mode for telegram-bot
yarn start-loc # production mode for locally

yarn ts # check types without building
```
